                        As of June 2024, I am actively looking for a job after completing my studies at <strong>USI</strong> in Lugano, Switzerland.
                        Currently I'm located in Lugano, after spending an unhappy semester at <strong>EPFL</strong> in Lausanne,
                        and another semester at <strong>ETH</strong> in Zürich, which both are institutions globally renowned for their academic excellence.
                        
                        Also, I was privileged to have received a <strong>scholarship</strong>
                        for academic credit at my home university, <strong>USI</strong>, in Lugano.
                        
                        This further motivates me to strive for excellence in everything I undertake.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My main interests lie in backend development, with a strong
                        focus on <strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>.
                    
                        I find immense satisfaction in optimizing algorithms and
                        ensuring they perform at their best, as this directly contributes
                        to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of software systems.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        My ultimate career aspiration is to become a seasoned project manager.
                        I am deeply committed to expanding my skills in both development and
                        management, with the goal of overseeing and successfully delivering complex projects.
                        strong knowledge
                        Hard work and continuous improvement are fundamental values that drive me,
                        and I am always eager to embrace challenges and seize opportunities for growth.

                    <p>
                        In summary, I am a highly motivated and driven individual with
                        a passion for <strong>programming</strong>, <strong>management</strong>, 
                        and continuous learning. I am currently pursuing my studies
                        at <strong>EPFL</strong>, leveraging my experiences from <strong>ETH</strong>
                        and previous projects to excel in backend development.
                        
                        My goal is to further enhance my skills and knowledge to become 
                        a proficient project manager, contributing
                        to the success of ambitious and impactful initiatives.

                            <br>
                            There, I could take care of troubleshooting for various clients, fixing the network, and providing customer service. Also developed an archive management software to handle receipts from every customer.
                            <br>
                            The job presented challenges such as adapting to a different language and working hours, as Spain has a unique schedule due to high temperatures.

                            This project was part of the 'Alternanza scuola-lavoro' program, developed as a 3rd-year high school student.
                            <br>
                            Created a website for a library. Initially, we modeled the backend structure, applying <strong>Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)</strong>
                            principles to structure user interaction with the system using <strong>C#</strong> and <strong>.NET 4.0</strong>. Later, the site was developed using <strong>HTML</strong>, <strong>CSS</strong>, and <strong>jQuery</strong> 
                            for static content, and then transitioned to WordPress for dynamic content management.
                            <br>

                            - <strong>Adaptability.</strong> Transitioning from static to dynamic web development.
                            <br>
                            - <strong>Project Management.</strong> Completing a significant project within a set timeframe.

                    This utility is useful to insert company's details inside a standard cover letter. This is not good behaviour,
                    but for minor jobs, for which my interest is small, I usually adapt the same cover letter instead of producing one
                    specially for each application (as it would be way too much time wasting otherwise). With this tool, I can easily
                    replace the information regarding the company (address, name and so on) and avoid doing it manually myself.
                    Also, the today's date is taken and inserted instead of '[Date]'. This replaces the field by looking for '[field-name]'
                    inside the text

Dear [Recipient's Name],

I am writing to express my strong interest in the [Position Name] at [Company Name]. As a final year student at Università della Svizzera italiana, with a passion for backend development and algorithms optimization, I am excited about the opportunity to contribute my skills and experiences to a dynamic software company like [Company Name].

Throughout my academic journey at ETH and EPFL, I have actively sought to apply my knowledge in real-world settings. At USI, I led a team of 5 developers in implementing authentication with OAuth2 APIs and achieving 97% code coverage with top-quality ratings. I also co-led a team of 14 in developing a Web-App, where I optimized backend performance using SpringBoot and enhanced frontend animations with Vue.js.

My proficiency extends to various technologies, including Java, C#, and frameworks like Vue.js. Additionally, I am currently exploring AI and machine learning, taking an introduction to Machine Learning this semester, which I believe will further complement my skill set.

I find immense joy in collaborating with teams, understanding the importance of the human side in driving successful projects. As I aspire to grow and learn continuously, I am particularly drawn to [Company Name]'s commitment to innovation and technological advancement.

I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how my experiences align with [Company Name]'s vision and how I can contribute to your continued success. Thank you for considering my application. I eagerly look forward to the possibility of joining your talented team.

Sincerely,

Enrico
