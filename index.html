                <h2>Welcome to My Personal Website</h2>
                <p>
                    I have dedicated the past few years to honing my skills and pursuing my passions in <strong>programming</strong>
                    and <strong>management</strong>.
                    <br>
                    Through various projects at my <strong>university</strong> and even during my high school years,
                    I have gained valuable experience and acquired a strong foundation in these fields.
                    <br>
                    I thrive on ambition and thrive in high-pressure environments as they bring out the best in me, increasing my productivity and drive.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    Currently, I am pursuing my studies at <strong>EPFL</strong> in Lausanne, Switzerland,
                    following a successful exchange semester at <strong>ETH</strong> in Zurich.
                    <br>
                    Both institutions are globally renowned for their academic excellence, and I am privileged to have received a <strong>scholarship</strong>
                    for academic credit at my home university, <strong>USI</strong>, in Lugano.
                    <br>
                    This further motivates me to strive for excellence in everything I undertake.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    My main interests lie in backend development, with a strong focus on <strong>algorithms and data structures</strong>.
                    I find immense satisfaction in optimizing algorithms and ensuring they perform at their best, as this directly contributes
                    to the overall efficiency and effectiveness of software systems.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    My ultimate career aspiration is to become a seasoned project manager. I am deeply committed to expanding my skills in
                    both development and management, with the goal of overseeing and successfully delivering complex projects.
                    <br>
                    Hard work and continuous improvement are fundamental values that drive me, and I am always eager to embrace challenges
                    and seize opportunities for growth.
                  </p>
                  
                  <p>
                    In summary, I am a highly motivated and driven individual with a passion for <strong>programming</strong>,
                    <strong>management</strong>, and continuous learning. I am currently pursuing my studies at <strong>EPFL</strong>,
                    leveraging my experiences from <strong>ETH</strong> and previous projects to excel in backend development.
                    <br>
                    My goal is to further enhance my skills and knowledge to become a proficient project manager, contributing
                    to the success of ambitious and impactful initiatives.
